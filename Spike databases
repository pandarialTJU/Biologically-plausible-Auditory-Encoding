The Spike-TIMIT and Spike-TIDIGITS databases are stored in this link:

The auditory spiking databases are encoded from the original datasets TIMIT https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC93S1 and TIDIGITS https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC93S10

I have also uploaded the source code to encode TIMIT corpus into spikes: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tBlr0Rkr6MIc0tV4eBMMAOliulgr-pBI/view?usp=sharing
